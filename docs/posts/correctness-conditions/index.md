# Correctness Conditions

This section covers in great length about the topic of the correctness of concurrent programs.

What do we have in this topic? Well, if you think of a program like a theorem then just like talking about the correctness of a theorem, some matters we can talk about regarding this topic are:
- Q1. What does it mean for a program (theorem) to be correct? This all depends on our perspective of "correctness". This perspective is formalized by a set of axioms and definitions. Some correctness conditions may be useful, some may be not quite. This leads to another question: Q1'. What is a useful set of axioms and definitions?
- Q2. How to establish the correctness of a program (theorem)?
- Q3. How to derive results from or reason about a correct program (theorem)?
